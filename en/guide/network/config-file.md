# Configuration File

Supports specifying the configuration file path using the -c parameter. 

Note: The configuration file has a higher priority. When a configuration file is specified at runtime, all command line parameters except for -c will be ignored and only the configuration file will take effect.

```sh
./easytier-core -c ./config.toml
```

You can run `./easytier-core` directly without using any parameters to obtain the minimal configuration file. By running the command with parameters, you can get a configuration file corresponding to those parameters. The configuration file will be printed on the command line, and you can manually copy the relevant configuration and save it as a TOML file.

Below is an example of a configuration file along with annotations for various configuration options.

```toml
# instance name to identify this vpn node in same machine
instance_name = ""
# Hostname, used to identify the hostname of this device
hostname = ""
# Instance ID, usually a UUID, unique within the same VPN network
instance_id = ""
# The IPv4 address of this VPN node. If left empty, this node will only forward packets and will not create a TUN device
ipv4 = ""
# Automatically determined and assigned IP address by Easytier, starting from 10.0.0.1 by default. Warning: When using DHCP, if an IP conflict occurs within the network, the IP address will be automatically changed.
